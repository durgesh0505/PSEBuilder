Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm relatively new to PowerShell development and wanted to share a project I've been working on - **PSEBuilder** (PowerShell Script to EXE Builder).

### What is it?

It's a GUI tool built on top of PS2EXE that makes converting PowerShell scripts into standalone executables much easier, especially for those who prefer a visual interface over command-line options.

### Key Features:

- **Modern WPF Interface** - Clean, intuitive GUI instead of remembering PS2EXE command-line parameters
- **Resource Embedding** - Easily embed images, text files, JSON configs, and other resources directly into your EXE
- **Code Obfuscation** - Built-in variable/function name randomization for basic protection
- **Icon Management** - Simple icon selection and conversion from images
- **Real-time Validation** - Checks your script syntax before building
- **One-Click Building** - All PS2EXE options accessible through checkboxes and dropdowns

### Why I built it:

I found myself constantly looking up PS2EXE parameters and struggling with resource management in compiled scripts. This tool streamlines the entire workflow and makes it accessible even if you're not familiar with all the PS2EXE switches.

### Tech Stack:

- PowerShell WPF (XAML)
- PS2EXE module for compilation
- Built-in resource embedding system

### Links:

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/durgesh0505/PSEBuilder
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides included in the repo

### What's Next:

Planning to add configuration presets, batch conversion, and digital signing support in future versions.

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions! This is one of my first projects in the PowerShell community, so any constructive criticism is welcome. ðŸ˜Š
